Computed:
Computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies! This also means the
following computed property will never update, because Date.now() is not a reactive
dependency. Computed Values are Getter only!

var vm = new Vue({
  el: '#demo',
  data: {
    firstName: 'Foo',
    lastName: 'Bar'
  },
  computed: {
    fullName: {
        get: {
            function () {
              return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
            }
        }
        set: function(newValue) {
            var names = newValue.split(' ')
            this.firstName
        }
    }
  }
})

computed: {
  now: function () {
    return Date.now()
  }
}

Method:
In comparison, a method invocation will always run the function whenever a re-render
happens.
